# GrowBuddy User Research Presentation Script

## Chart 1: Daily Screen Time by Age Group

Our research reveals that children's screen time increases significantly with age. As shown in the chart, children aged 10-11 spend an average of 164 minutes (approximately 2.7 hours) daily on screen activities, which increases to 196 minutes (about 3.3 hours) by ages 12-13. This upward trend indicates that as children enter early adolescence, their dependency on digital devices strengthens. These findings emphasize the need for the GrowBuddy application to specifically address how to balance screen time with other beneficial developmental activities.

## Chart 2: Extracurricular Participation by Gender

We observed notable gender differences in extracurricular participation. Girls show higher engagement in club activities (29%) and creative lessons (37%) compared to boys (24% and 27% respectively). While sports remain the most popular extracurricular activity for both genders, boys demonstrate significantly higher participation rates (75% versus 65% for girls). These insights have important implications for GrowBuddy's personalization features - we need to consider existing activity preferences while also encouraging children to try different types of activities to expand their comfort zones.

## Chart 3: Activity Access by Household Income

The data exposes how socioeconomic factors impact children's growth opportunities. In high-income households, 84% of children participate in sports, compared to just 59% in low-income families. Similarly, for music, dance, and art lessons, high-income families show 62% participation versus 41% in low-income households. This disparity highlights GrowBuddy's potential value in providing growth opportunities for all children regardless of socioeconomic background. In our design, we'll create challenges that require minimal resources while maximizing growth potential.

## Chart 4: Growth Mindset vs. Academic Performance

Our research confirms the positive impact of growth mindset on academic achievement. Students with fixed mindsets average 65 points on academic measurements, while those with growth mindsets achieve an average of 85 points. This 20-point difference clearly demonstrates mindset's significant influence on learning outcomes. This finding provides strong support for GrowBuddy's core design philosophy - helping children enhance learning effectiveness and ability to face challenges through growth mindset development. The application will promote growth mindset formation by emphasizing effort, strategy development, and learning from mistakes rather than fixed abilities.
